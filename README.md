# Comparison of Sorting Algorithms
## Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort - Project 1
Object-oriented program that implements several sorting algorithms of different algorithm complexities. Differently ordered files are then sorted using several algorithms (selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort) and the number of comparisons are displayed.
